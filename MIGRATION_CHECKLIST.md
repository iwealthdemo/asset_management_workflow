# LLM API Service Migration Checklist

## ✅ **Phase 1: LLM Service Creation (COMPLETED)**

- ✅ Created new Replit project for LLM API service
- ✅ Copied all service files (main.py, services/, utils/)
- ✅ Added environment secrets (OPENAI_API_KEY, SERVICE_API_KEY, DEFAULT_VECTOR_STORE_ID)
- ✅ Implemented production-ready concurrency management (20 concurrent, 200/min rate limiting)
- ✅ Created comprehensive API endpoints for all LLM operations
- ✅ Built TypeScript integration service for Investment Portal

## 🔄 **Phase 2: Investment Portal Integration (NEXT STEPS)**

### **2.1 Replace Background Job Service**
- [ ] Update `server/services/backgroundJobService.ts` to use LLM API instead of Python
- [ ] Replace `pythonVectorStoreService.ts` calls with `llmApiService.ts`
- [ ] Test document upload → LLM processing → results flow

### **2.2 Replace Analysis Services**
- [ ] Update document analysis to use `/documents/analyze` endpoint
- [ ] Replace cross-document search with `/documents/search` endpoint  
- [ ] Update web search to use dedicated LLM service endpoint

### **2.3 Environment Configuration**
- [ ] Add LLM service environment variables to Investment Portal:
  ```
  LLM_SERVICE_URL=https://your-llm-service.replit.app
  LLM_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key
  ```

### **2.4 Update API Routes**
- [ ] Modify `server/routes.ts` to proxy LLM requests through new service
- [ ] Update error handling for external service calls
- [ ] Add service health checks and fallback logic

## 🧪 **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**

### **3.1 Integration Testing**
- [ ] Test document upload workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Validate background job processing works with API calls
- [ ] Test concurrent access from multiple Investment Portal users
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality works identically

### **3.2 Performance Testing**
- [ ] Test large document processing (15-25MB files)
- [ ] Validate response times for document analysis
- [ ] Test concurrent load on LLM service (multiple proposals)

### **3.3 Error Handling**
- [ ] Test LLM service unavailability scenarios
- [ ] Validate proper error messages to users
- [ ] Test service timeout handling

## 🚀 **Phase 4: Production Deployment**

### **4.1 LLM Service Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy LLM service to internet-accessible URL
- [ ] Configure production API keys and secrets
- [ ] Test service accessibility from Investment Portal

### **4.2 Investment Portal Updates**
- [ ] Update environment variables with production LLM service URL
- [ ] Deploy updated Investment Portal with LLM integration
- [ ] Monitor service health and performance

### **4.3 Cleanup**
- [ ] Remove old Python integration files:
  - [ ] `server/services/pythonVectorStoreService.ts`
  - [ ] `python_services/` directory
  - [ ] Python-related dependencies
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect microservices architecture

## 📊 **Validation Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] All document processing features work identically
- [ ] Background job processing maintains current behavior
- [ ] Document analysis results are equivalent or better
- [ ] Cross-document search maintains functionality
- [ ] Investment insights generation works properly

### **Performance Requirements**  
- [ ] Document processing times remain acceptable (< 3 minutes)
- [ ] Service handles 20+ concurrent requests
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents service abuse
- [ ] Error responses are helpful and actionable

### **Reliability Requirements**
- [ ] Service gracefully handles failures and timeouts
- [ ] Investment Portal continues working if LLM service is temporarily unavailable
- [ ] Proper monitoring and logging for debugging

## 🔧 **Configuration Reference**

### **LLM Service Environment Variables**
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
SERVICE_API_KEY=secure-random-key-here
DEFAULT_VECTOR_STORE_ID=vs_687584b54f908191b0a21ffa42948fb5

# Optional (with defaults)
PORT=5000
FLASK_ENV=production
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=20
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=200
```

### **Investment Portal Environment Variables**
```bash
# Add these new variables
LLM_SERVICE_URL=https://your-llm-service.replit.app
LLM_SERVICE_API_KEY=same-as-service-api-key

# Existing variables remain unchanged
DATABASE_URL=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=... (can be removed after migration)
```

## 📈 **Expected Benefits**

### **Immediate Benefits**
- ✅ **Microservices architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ **Reusability** - LLM service can be used by multiple applications
- ✅ **Scalability** - Independent scaling of AI operations
- ✅ **Reliability** - Production-grade concurrency and rate limiting

### **Long-term Benefits**
- ✅ **Maintainability** - Easier to update and debug AI features
- ✅ **Flexibility** - Can easily switch or add AI providers
- ✅ **Cost optimization** - Better resource management for AI operations
- ✅ **Multi-application support** - CRM, research tools, analytics can use same service

## ⏰ **Migration Timeline**

- **Phase 1**: ✅ **Completed** (LLM service created and configured)
- **Phase 2**: **1-2 hours** (Integration code updates)  
- **Phase 3**: **30 minutes** (Testing and validation)
- **Phase 4**: **15 minutes** (Production deployment)

**Total estimated time: 2-3 hours for complete migration**

## 🆘 **Rollback Plan**

If issues occur during migration:

1. **Keep old code intact** until migration is fully validated
2. **Use feature flags** to switch between old and new implementations
3. **Environment variable** to toggle LLM service usage
4. **Quick rollback**: Change `LLM_SERVICE_URL` to point to fallback

The migration is designed to be **non-destructive** and **easily reversible** until final cleanup phase.

## 🎯 **Current Status: Ready for Phase 2**

Your LLM API service is created and ready. The next step is updating the Investment Portal integration code to use the new microservice architecture.
